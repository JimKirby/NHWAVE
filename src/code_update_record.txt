by Cheng Zhang
23/11/2016

■Bug Fixes
·Fixed two bugs that leaded to unstability since two variables were not initialized.

■Additions to Functions
·Added a function to record max runup of wave.
·Added a function to record varying bathymetry.
·Added a function to hot start simulation.
·Added a function to limit max maximum Froude number.

·Added a function to impose nesting data as boundary conditions.

■Changes
·Changed Sommerfeld open boundary condition to Orlanski open boundary condition.
·Changed subroutine flux_left_right_boundary to impose velocity at inflow boundary.
