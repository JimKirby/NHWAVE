UPDATE_00001
by Cheng Zhang
23/11/2016

Bug Fixes
路Fixed two bugs that leaded to unstability since two variables were not initialized.

Additions to Functions
路Added a function to record max runup of wave.
路Added a function to record varying bathymetry.
路Added a function to hot start simulation.
路Added a function to limit max maximum Froude number.
路Added a function to generate irregular waves with a internal wave maker.
路Added a function to impose nesting data as boundary conditions.

Changes
路Changed Sommerfeld open boundary condition to Orlanski open boundary condition.
路Changed subroutine flux_left_right_boundary to impose velocity at inflow boundary.
路Changed subroutine probes to output velocity components at each layer when setting 
 z=-1.0 in stat.txt
